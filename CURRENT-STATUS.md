# Current Implementation Status

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Branch**: claude/debug-event-queue-delays-011CUfzN1Mf5WFrDnMgNtPwf
**All commits merged**: Yes

## What We KNOW Works (User Confirmed)

### ✅ Requirement #2: Start During Cheap Window
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Evidence**: User confirmed "started charging on time at 23:30"
- **Date Confirmed**: 2025-11-01

### ✅ Status Output in checkSchedule()
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Evidence**: User showed output: "No action: outside window (23:30 to 05:30), not charging (SOC 64%, ...)"
- **This confirms**: Commit 3fd72e0 is deployed

---

## What We KNOW is Broken (User Confirmed)

### ❌ Requirement #1: Stop at Target SOC
- **Status**: FAILING
- **Evidence**: User reported "charged to 98% despite setting for 80% 1st night and 90% second night"
- **Expected**: Stop at 80% or 90%
- **Actual**: Continues to 98%
- **Date Confirmed**: 2025-11-01 (two nights in a row)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. User has deployed commit 3fd72e0 (status output works)
2. User has NOT yet deployed commit df82a2b (SOC stopping fix)
3. Therefore: SOC stopping is broken because the fix isn't deployed yet

**Fix Available**: Commit df82a2b adds:
- OVMS charge limit command: `charge limit soc <target>`
- SOC monitoring in checkSchedule(): stops if `soc >= targetSOC`

**Action Required**: User must deploy df82a2b to OVMS device

---

## What We DON'T KNOW (Needs Testing)

### ⚠️ Requirement #3: Skip If Already Charged
- **Status**: UNKNOWN
- **Code exists**: Yes (lines 660-667)
- **Tested**: No
- **Test needed**: Plug in with SOC = 76%, skipIfAbove = 75%, confirm it skips

### ⚠️ Requirement #4: Auto-Detect Battery
- **Status**: UNKNOWN
- **Code exists**: Yes (getBatteryParams)
- **Tested**: No
- **Test needed**: Run `charging.status()`, verify capacity and SOH are correct

### ⚠️ Requirement #5: Ready-By Scheduling
- **Status**: UNKNOWN
- **Code exists**: Yes (calculateOptimalStart)
- **Tested**: No
- **Question**: Is user using fixed schedule or ready-by mode?

### ⚠️ Requirement #6: Notifications
- **Status**: UNKNOWN
- **Code exists**: Yes (safeNotify calls throughout)
- **Enhanced**: Commit 2e34bb8 added cost/time details
- **Tested**: No
- **Test needed**: Verify OVMS Connect app receives notifications

### ⚠️ Requirement #9: Safety Checks
- **Status**: UNKNOWN
- **Code exists**: Yes (canCharge, getChargeBlockReason)
- **Tested**: No
- **Test needed**: Try to start when unplugged, when already charging, etc.

## Critical Questions to Answer

### Q1: Does OVMS Support "charge limit soc" Command?
**Why this matters**: Our fix relies on this command. If it's not supported, we need a different approach.

**How to test**:
```
charge limit soc 80
charge mode storage
charge start
```

**If it works**: Should stop at 80%
**If it doesn't work**: Need ticker-based SOC monitoring (check every 1-5 minutes)

### Q2: How Often Do Clock Events Actually Run?
**Why this matters**: We check SOC every 30 minutes. If charging fast, we might overshoot.

**Example**:
- 7kW charger on 40kWh battery = 17.5% per hour
- Check at 70%, next check (30 min later) = 78.75%
- Should stop (>80%), but what if it doesn't trigger in time?

**Possible issue**: 30-minute interval too slow for fast chargers

### Q3: What Charging Rate is User Using?
**Why this matters**: Determines if 30-min interval is sufficient

**Test**: Run `charging.status()` and check "Charge rate" value

## Deployment Status by Commit

| Commit | Feature | Deployed to OVMS? | Evidence |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| 3fd72e0 | Status output in checkSchedule() | ✅ YES | User showed output working |
| 2e0aefd | Event queue fix (setup-events) | ❓ UNKNOWN | Not tested |
| 2e34bb8 | Cost/time notifications | ❓ UNKNOWN | User said "not yet deployed" |
| df82a2b | **SOC stopping fix** | ❓ UNKNOWN | User said "not yet deployed" but also "all commits merged" |

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION NEEDED**:
- User said "all commits are now merged" (in git)
- But also said latest pushes "not yet incorporated" (on OVMS device)
- **Which commits are actually running on the OVMS device?**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Clarify Deployment State**:
   - Which commit SHA is currently on OVMS device at `/store/scripts/lib/charging.js`?
   - Simple test: Does `charging.start()` print "Setting charge limit to X%"?

2. **Deploy Critical Fix**:
   - Upload df82a2b version of charging.js to OVMS
   - Run `script reload`
   - Test tonight's charge

3. **Verify OVMS Command Support**:
   - Test: `charge limit soc 80`
   - If unsupported, need different approach

4. **Systematic Testing**:
   - Go through REQUIREMENTS-VERIFICATION.md
   - Test each requirement
   - Document results

---

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK: SOC Stopping Still Broken
- **If df82a2b not deployed**: Will charge to 98% again tonight
- **If `charge limit soc` not supported**: Fix won't work even when deployed
- **If 30-min interval too slow**: May overshoot target by 5-10%

### MEDIUM RISK: Unknown Side Effects
- Haven't tested safety checks, notifications, ready-by mode
- Changes might have broken something else
- No regression testing done

### LOW RISK: Event Queue
- Fix implemented and seems sound
- Less critical than SOC stopping

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **URGENT**: User confirms which version is on OVMS device:
   ```
   # On OVMS, run:
   script eval print("Test: " + (charging.start.toString().indexOf("charge limit soc") > -1))
   ```
   If output is `true`: df82a2b is deployed
   If output is `false`: df82a2b is NOT deployed

2. **URGENT**: Test if OVMS supports charge limit:
   ```
   charge limit soc 80
   ```
   Check for error message

3. **Deploy if needed**: Upload latest charging.js with SOC fix

4. **Monitor tonight**: Watch if it stops at target SOC

5. **Start systematic verification**: Work through REQUIREMENTS-VERIFICATION.md
